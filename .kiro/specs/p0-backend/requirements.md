# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building the P0 (MVP) backend for the Recruitment Agent platform. The backend will serve as a NestJS-based API server that provides core chat functionality, conversational requirement discovery, basic candidate search, and user profile management. The architecture follows topic-agnostic principles to enable future extensibility across domains while delivering essential recruitment capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core API Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a robust NestJS backend infrastructure, so that the platform can handle API requests, WebSocket connections, and integrate with external services reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize a NestJS application with proper module structure
2. WHEN a client connects THEN the system SHALL support both HTTP REST endpoints and WebSocket connections for real-time chat
3. WHEN external services are called THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling, retries, and rate limiting
4. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL provide health check endpoints for monitoring
5. IF environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL fail gracefully with clear error messages

### Requirement 2: Chat Interface and Session Management

**User Story:** As a recruiter, I want to engage in multi-turn conversations with the AI agent, so that I can iteratively discover role requirements and get assistance with recruitment tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts a chat THEN the system SHALL create a new session with unique identifier
2. WHEN a user sends a message THEN the system SHALL store the message in the conversation history
3. WHEN the AI responds THEN the system SHALL stream the response in real-time via WebSocket
4. WHEN a session is inactive for 30 minutes THEN the system SHALL persist the session state
5. WHEN a user reconnects THEN the system SHALL restore their previous conversation context
6. IF a session exceeds token limits THEN the system SHALL implement conversation summarization

### Requirement 3: Conversational Requirement Discovery

**User Story:** As a recruiter, I want the AI to help me discover and refine role requirements through natural conversation, so that I can clearly define what I'm looking for in candidates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user describes a role THEN the system SHALL extract technical skills, experience levels, and soft skills
2. WHEN requirements are unclear THEN the system SHALL ask clarifying questions about specific aspects
3. WHEN multiple requirements are mentioned THEN the system SHALL organize them into structured categories
4. WHEN a conversation progresses THEN the system SHALL build a comprehensive role profile
5. IF conflicting requirements are detected THEN the system SHALL highlight inconsistencies and seek clarification

### Requirement 4: Basic Candidate Search Integration

**User Story:** As a recruiter, I want to search for potential candidates based on discovered requirements, so that I can find relevant profiles quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN role requirements are established THEN the system SHALL integrate with external search APIs (Tavily or similar)
2. WHEN a search is performed THEN the system SHALL query multiple sources for candidate profiles
3. WHEN search results are returned THEN the system SHALL rank and filter results based on relevance
4. WHEN no results are found THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative search strategies
5. IF search APIs are unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade and inform the user

### Requirement 5: User Profile and Memory System

**User Story:** As a recruiter, I want the system to remember my preferences and past interactions, so that future conversations are more personalized and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user first interacts THEN the system SHALL create a user profile with basic preferences
2. WHEN conversations occur THEN the system SHALL learn and store user quirks and preferences
3. WHEN similar roles are discussed THEN the system SHALL reference past successful searches and requirements
4. WHEN a user returns THEN the system SHALL apply learned preferences to new conversations
5. IF user data needs to be deleted THEN the system SHALL support complete profile removal

### Requirement 6: LLM Integration and Orchestration

**User Story:** As a system, I want to integrate with LLM providers efficiently, so that conversations are intelligent, contextual, and cost-effective.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN LLM calls are made THEN the system SHALL use OpenRouter or similar abstraction for vendor independence
2. WHEN context is needed THEN the system SHALL implement RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) with vector search
3. WHEN responses are generated THEN the system SHALL stream output for real-time user experience
4. WHEN token limits are approached THEN the system SHALL implement context window management
5. IF LLM services fail THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff and fallback options

### Requirement 7: Data Persistence and Caching

**User Story:** As a system, I want reliable data storage and caching, so that user sessions, profiles, and conversation history are preserved efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data needs persistence THEN the system SHALL use PostgreSQL for structured data storage
2. WHEN fast access is needed THEN the system SHALL use Redis for session caching and temporary data
3. WHEN embeddings are created THEN the system SHALL store them in a vector database (Milvus or Pinecone)
4. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL implement proper transaction rollback
5. IF cache is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to primary database with performance logging

### Requirement 8: Security and Authentication

**User Story:** As a security-conscious organization, I want proper authentication and authorization, so that user data and system resources are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the system THEN the system SHALL implement JWT-based authentication
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL validate authorization for each endpoint
3. WHEN sensitive data is stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt data at rest and in transit
4. WHEN external APIs are called THEN the system SHALL securely manage API keys and secrets
5. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL log security events and block access

### Requirement 9: Configuration and Environment Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want flexible configuration management, so that the system can be deployed across different environments with appropriate settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load configuration from environment variables
2. WHEN different environments are used THEN the system SHALL support development, staging, and production configs
3. WHEN secrets are needed THEN the system SHALL load them securely without exposing in logs
4. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL validate required parameters at startup
5. IF invalid configuration is detected THEN the system SHALL fail fast with descriptive error messages

### Requirement 10: Monitoring and Observability

**User Story:** As an operations team, I want comprehensive monitoring and logging, so that I can track system health, performance, and user interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requests are processed THEN the system SHALL log request/response details with correlation IDs
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL capture detailed error information and stack traces
3. WHEN performance metrics are needed THEN the system SHALL expose Prometheus-compatible metrics
4. WHEN system health is checked THEN the system SHALL provide detailed health status for all dependencies
5. IF critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL alert operations team through configured channels
